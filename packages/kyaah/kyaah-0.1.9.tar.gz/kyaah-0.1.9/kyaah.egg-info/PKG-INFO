        Kyaah abstract away cognitive over-head of sending SMTP mail, together with other mailing operations things like, mail with file, tokens etc.
        
        # Simple use of kyaah
        First we recommend creating a virtual environment `python3 -m venv venv` and then activate it `source venv/bin/activate`
        
        Once that finish now install the library using
        
        ```
        pip install kyaah
        ```
        
        Wait for the installation to finish, basically the library was uploaded using `sdist` (Source Distribution). After that create a new file let call it `test.py` in the file paste the below code with your credentials.
        
        ```python
        import kyaah
                    
        sender = "my_email@gmail.com"
        receiver = ["receiver_1@gmail.com", "receiver_2@gmail.com"]
        passwd = "*********" # use app password
        
        server = "gmail"
        subj = f"Hellow world!"
        body = "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet adipisicing elit, rerum voluptate ipsum volupt."
        
        kyaah.sendMail(from_usr=sender, to_usr=receiver, svr=server, subject=subj, body=body, mail_passwd=passwd)
        ```
        
        save the file and navigate to where the file is located in terminal and your are ready to go (run the file)
        
        ```
        python3 test.py
