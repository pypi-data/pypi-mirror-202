# `tf_gnns` - A Hackable GraphNets library
![alt-img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mylonasc/tf_gnns/main/doc/figures/tfgnns_logo2.png)
A library for easy construction of message-passing networks in tensorflow keras.
It is inspired largely by this [DeepMind paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01261) and the corresponding open-sourced library ([original graph_nets library](https://github.com/deepmind/graph_nets))

The `tf_gnns` library has no external dependencies except tensorflow 2.x (there is no support for tf 1.x graphs/sessions-based computation). 
It implements some alternative design constraints from `graph_nets` taking advantage of some facilities keras provides to make complex models easily and without large drops in performance.

`tf_gnns` is built to support arbitrary node/edge/global attributes and update functions.
A set of convenience functions providing MLP construction with keras are also provided (i.e., handling input/output sizes for valid networks) that replaces sonnet.

The main motivation for this library was the absense of a relatively short and efficient implementation of GNNs that was explicitly created to take advantage of keras's functionalities.
GNN implementations which take advantage of `tensorflow_probability` functionality are to be released in the future (as the one used in \[2\]).

## Installing `tf_gnns`
Install with `pip`:
```
pip install tf_gnns
```

# Examples

## `tf_gnns` basics
You may inspect some basic functionality on the following colab notebook:

## list sorting example
(Example from the original `deepmind/graph_nets` library)
If you are familiar with the original `graph_nets` library, this example will help you understand how you can transition to `tf_gnns`.

Sort a list of elements.
This notebook and the accompanying code demonstrates how to use the Graph Nets library to learn to sort a list of elements.

A list of elements is treated as a fully connected graph between the elements. 
The network is trained to label the start node, and which (directed) edges correspond to the links to the next largest element, for each node.

After training, the prediction ability is tested by comparing its output to true sorted lists. Then the network's ability to generalise is tested, by using it to sort larger lists.

## Performance
From some initial tests the performance of the `tf_gnns` library seems to be at least as good as `deepmind/graph_nets` when using tensor dictionaries.
