"""coBib's TUI module.

This module implements coBib's curses-based TUI.
The code is split into several submodules:
* `cobib.tui.buffer`: implements a general `TextBuffer` and `InputBuffer` to handle in- and output.
* `cobib.tui.frame`: implements the `Frame` class which tightly couples a `TextBuffer` to a
  `curses.pad` and is used by the `TUI` as the main interaction window.
* `cobib.tui.state`: gathers the stateful-information of the `TUI` in a simple object.
* `cobib.tui.tui.TUI`: implements the actual TUI.
