# Brawling 2.0

Sync + async wrapper for the Brawl Stars API (additionally via an unofficial proxy) and BrawlAPI by Brawlify

## Installation

To install normally (only sync, no cache)

```
pip install brawling
```

There are three additional extras you can install: `async`, `cache`, `acache`

To install with caching support (only sync, installs `requests-cache`)

```
pip install brawling[cache]
```

To install with async support (will install `aiohttp`)

```
pip install brawling[async]
```

To install with async caching support (will also install `aiohttp`, `aiohttp-client-cache` and `aiosqlite`)

```
pip install brawling[acache]
```

## Usage

Usage is fairly simple and straightforward:

```py
import brawling

# either a token, or a path to the file with it
TOKEN = "..."

client = brawling.Client(TOKEN)
player = client.get_player("#YOURTAG")
print(f"Hi, {player.tag}")

# or, asynchronously

client = brawling.AsyncClient(TOKEN)
player = await client.get_player("#YOURTAG")
print(f"Hi, {player.tag}")
```

If you only need to make one or few calls, you can use a context manager:

```py
with brawling.Client(TOKEN) as client:
    player = client.get_player("#YOURTAG")

# or, asynchronously
async with brawling.AsyncClient(TOKEN) as client:
    player = await client.get_player("#YOURTAG")
```

If you want to paginate over data, there are also paginator functions available to do exactly that:

```py
pages = client.page_brawler_rankings(
    brawling.BrawlerID.SHELLY,
    per_page=10, region='us', max=200
)

# ^ this operation was immediate, no data was fetched yet

for page in pages:
    # prints a list of 10 items
    print(page)

# if asynchronous, use 'await client.page_xx()' and 'async for'
```

When initializing a client, there are additional options:

```py
Client(token: str,
       proxy = False,
       strict_errors = True,
       cache = False)
```

`proxy` - uses the Royale API proxy (read [Special thanks](#special-thanks) before using!) to make requests, useful if you don't have a static IP.

`strict_errors` - throw an error if the API returned one, if set to `False`, will return an `ErrorResponse` object instead.

`cache` - enables caching of responses, caching period is determined by either the API, or a fallback default value of 10 minutes.

## Common issues

If you are having troubles with getting the `AsyncClient` to work, make sure that you initialize it inside an asynchronous function, like so:

```py
client = None

# correct
async def init():
    client = brawling.AsyncClient("...")

asyncio.run(init())

# wrong
client = brawling.AsyncClient("...")
```

## Special thanks

Thanks to [brawlify](https://brawlify.com) for the amazing project [BrawlAPI](https://brawlapi.com)

Thanks to [Royale API](https://royaleapi.com/) for providing a [proxy service](https://docs.royaleapi.com/proxy.html#how-to-use-with-the-clash-royale-api) to bypass the static IP limitation
