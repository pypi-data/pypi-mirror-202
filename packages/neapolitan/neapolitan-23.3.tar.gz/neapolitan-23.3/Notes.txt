            # TODO: make the lookup field configurable. Determined by
            # lookup_field and lookup_url_kwarg. ???: how to handle the type of
            # the converter? (int, slug, etc.)
            # It's just a string that gets passed to path(). SO an extra view
            # field with the name of a registered converter.
            path(

The type of the PK... ðŸ¤”
    - Mapping from Field type to converter

That could be the default easily enough: for a specific view you just specify the converter. You create a project base-class if that's what you need. (e.g. my `hash` converter)
