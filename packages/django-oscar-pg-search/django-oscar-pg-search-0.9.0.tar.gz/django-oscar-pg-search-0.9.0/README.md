Postgresql search handler for Django-Oscar
==========================================
This creates a search handler without the need of any search backend. It is designed for the e-commerce framework [Oscar](https://github.com/django-oscar/django-oscar).

It is implemented a little bit expensive but uses 4 annotated search vectors: \* upc \* title \* meta\_description \* meta\_title

This way the search can be manipulated through the meta fields. It is running productive in a heavily customized env for many months now. I think it should scale up to 5000 Products with 10 Attributes depending on how the products are loaded. We use it fully lazy with endless scrolling.


To-Do
-----

- Provide a generic way to use filter forms
- Writing Tests


Features
--------

+ Don't need to use some additional search backend like elastic
+ Creates filters (facets) for:
    - Data that is directly attached to the Product model
    - including foreign key choices
    - AttributeValues of the products
    - StockRecord entries


Installation
------------

Install using pip:

```bash
pip install django-oscar-pg-search
```

```python
# settings.py

# replace 'oscar.apps.search.apps.SearchConfig' by 'oscar_pg_search.apps.PgSearchConfig'
INSTALLED_APPS = [
	# 'oscar.apps.search.apps.SearchConfig',
    'oscar_pg_search.apps.PgSearchConfig',
]

OSCAR_PRODUCT_SEARCH_HANDLER = 'oscar_pg_search.postgres_search_handler.PostgresSearchHandler'

# To avoid exception, haystack is not used:
HAYSTACK_CONNECTIONS = {"default": {}}
```

Trigram search is our search algorithm. Enable it at your database by executing the following sql:

```
CREATE EXTENSION pg_trgm;
```


Settings
--------

If you want to add some fields that are directly attached to the Product
model:

```python
# settings.py
OSCAR_ATTACHED_PRODUCT_FIELDS = ['is_public', 'deposit', 'volume', 'weight',]
```
