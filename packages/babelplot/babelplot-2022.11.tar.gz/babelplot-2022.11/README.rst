===============================================================
BabelPlot: A Meta Plotting Library That Speaks Several Backends
===============================================================



Installation
============

This project is published on the `Python Package Index (PyPI) <https://pypi.org>`_ at: `https://pypi.org/project/babelplot <https://pypi.org/project/babelplot>`_. It should be installable from Python distribution platforms or Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). Otherwise, it can be installed from a command-line console:

- For all users, after acquiring administrative rights:
    - First installation: ``pip install babelplot``
    - Installation update: ``pip install --upgrade babelplot``
- For the current user (no administrative rights required):
    - First installation: ``pip install --user babelplot``
    - Installation update: ``pip install --user --upgrade babelplot``

Prior to using ``BabelPlot``, a (backend) plotting library must be installed. If in doubt, `Matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org>`_ should be installed.

.. note:: The `BabelPlot` project is currently in alpha stage: API and runtime stabilities are both unreliable.



Documentation
=============

The documentation is proposed in the form of a `Wiki site <https://src.koda.cnrs.fr/eric.debreuve/babelplot/-/wikis/home>`_.



Acknowledgments
===============

The project is developed with `PyCharm Community <https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm>`_.

The development relies on several open-source packages (see ``install_requires`` in ``setup.py``).

The code is formatted by `Black <https://github.com/psf/black>`_, *The Uncompromising Code Formatter*.

The imports are ordered by `isort <https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort>`_... *your imports, so you don't have to*.
