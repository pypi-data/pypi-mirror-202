# cf_changelog - Conflict-Free Changelog manager

Simple tool to support changelog modifications on different git branches without conflicts on merging.
Written in python, installable with pip.

## Usage
1. Install it from pip:
```bash
pip install cf_changelog
```
2. Create some changelog on different branches entries using:
```bash
cf_changelog add
```
It is recommended to run this from root of your repository.
This will invoke standard text editor (or notepad if standard editor is not configured), where you can fill a template with new features, bug fixes etc. Example:
```yaml
New:
    - One new cool feature
    - Another cool feature
Bugfix:
    - Fixed bug of previous feature
    - Fixed another bug
```

3. Commit newly created files.
4. Repeat 2 and 3 on different branches as many times as you need.
5. Merge all branches.
6. On merged branch run:
```bash
cf_changelog release X.Y.Z
```
where X.Y.Z is description of version you wan't to see in final changelog.
7. Commit registered changes in git repository
8. Enjoy your updated changelog.

## Project status
