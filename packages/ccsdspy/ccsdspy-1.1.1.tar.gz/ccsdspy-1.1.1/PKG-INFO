This community-developed package provides a Python interface for reading tightly packed bits in the `Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) <https://public.ccsds.org/default.aspx>`__ format used by many NASA and ESA missions. The library is developed with requirements sourced from the community and extensive automated testing.
 
Installation
============
To install ccsdspy

.. code::

   pip install ccsdspy

Usage Example
=============
The following example shows how simple it is to read in fixed length CCSDS packets.

.. code-block:: python
                
   import ccsdspy
   from ccsdspy import PacketField, PacketArray
   
   pkt = ccsdspy.FixedLength([
        PacketField(name='SHCOARSE', data_type='uint', bit_length=32),
        PacketField(name='SHFINE',   data_type='uint', bit_length=20),
        PacketField(name='OPMODE',   data_type='uint', bit_length=3),
        PacketField(name='SPACER',   data_type='fill', bit_length=1),
        PacketField(name='VOLTAGE',  data_type='int',  bit_length=8),
	PacketArray(
            name='SENSOR_GRID',
            data_type='uint',
            bit_length=16,
            array_shape=(32, 32),
            array_order='C'
	),
   ])
   
   result = pkt.load('mypackets.bin')
