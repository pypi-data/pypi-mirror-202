Pytanis includes a [Pretalx] client and all the tooling you need for conferences using [Pretalx], from handling the initial call for papers to creating the final program.

**Trivia**: The name *Pytanis* is a reference to [Prytanis] using the typical *py* prefix of [Python] tools. [Prytanis]
was the name given  to the leading members of the government of a city (polis) in ancient Greece.  Offices that used this
title usually had responsibility for presiding over councils of some kind, which met in the [Prytaneion]. Romani ite domum!


## Features

- [x] easily access [Google Sheets], potentially filled by some [Google Forms], and download sheets as data frames
- [x] easy to use [Pretalx] client that returns proper Python objects thanks to the power of [pydantic]
- [x] simple [HelpDesk] client for batch mails, e.g. to your reviewers
