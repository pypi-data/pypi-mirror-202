.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <libssh2.h>

int
libssh2_channel_signal_ex(LIBSSH2_CHANNEL *channel, const char *signame, unsigned int signame_len)

.SH DESCRIPTION
A signal can be delivered to the remote process/service.  Some servers or
systems may not implement signals, in which case they will probably ignore this
message.

\fIchannel\fP - Previously opened channel instance such as returned by
.BR libssh2_channel_open_ex(3)

\fIsigname\fP - The signal name is the same as the signal name constant, without the leading "SIG".

\fIsigname_len\fP - Length of passed signal name parameter.

There is also a macro \fIlibssh2_channel_signal(channel, signame)\fP that supplies the strlen of the signame.

.SH RETURN VALUE
Normal channel error codes.
LIBSSH2_ERROR_EAGAIN when it would block.
