``--template-branch <branch>``
------------------------------

The branch of the cookiecutter template repo to use for the new project. If not
specified, Briefcase will attempt to use a template branch matching the version
of Briefcase that is being used (i.e., if you're using Briefcase 0.3.9,
Briefcase will use the `v0.3.9` template branch when generating the app). If
you're using a development version of Briefcase, Briefcase will use the `main`
branch of the template.
