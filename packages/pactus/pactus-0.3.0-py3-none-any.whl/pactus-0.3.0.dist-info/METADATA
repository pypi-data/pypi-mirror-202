# pactus

Standing from *Path Classification Tools for Unifying Strategies*, **pactus**
is a Python library that allows testing different classification methods on
several trajectory datasets.

It comes with some built-in models and datasets according to the
state-of-the-art in trajectory classification. However, it is implemented in an
extensible way, so the users can build their own models and datasets.

> NOTE: Built-in datasets don't contain the raw trajectoy data. When a
> dataset is loaded for the first time it downloads the necessary data
> automatically.

## Instalation

```bash
pip install pactus
```
