"""This module exposes "built-in" DearPyGui item types as class objects.
Instances of item type classes act as interfaces to a specific item
throughout their lifetime. Users do not need to import this module --
All objects are added to the `dearpypixl` namespace automatically.
"""
# Workarounds for DearPyGui/Imgui bugs/lack of fundamental
# features, additional DearPyGui hooks, and *small* API
# extensions are added here.
