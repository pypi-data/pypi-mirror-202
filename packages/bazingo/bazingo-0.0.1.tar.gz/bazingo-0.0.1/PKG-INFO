# Bazingo 0.0.1

Bazingo aims to replace the conventional `Notebook` widget with a less buggy and more customizable alternative.

The following is planned to be implemented:
- [ ] Put custom widgets to tabbar -->
- [ ] Tabs can have a close button and an icon at the same time
- [ ] Tabs can be pinned
- [ ] Tabs can be grouped
- [ ] Scroll through tabs 
- [ ] Search through tabs (list tabs)
