# SPGCI

Python Client for the [S&P Global Commodity Insights API](https://developer.platts.com).

## Installation

Requires Python >= 3.8.10.

```

## Getting Started

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/achristie/images/blob/master/readme.ipynb)

```python
    import spgci as ci

    ci.set_credentials(<username>, <password>, <appkey>)
    mdd = ci.MarketData()

    symbols = ["PCAAS00", "PCAAT00"]
    mdd.get_assessments_by_symbol_current(symbol=symbols)
```

Alternatively, you can set your credentials via Environment Variables and _omit_ the `set_credentials` call:
| Environment Variable | Description |
| :------------------- | :----------------|
| SPGCI_USERNAME | Your Username |
| SPGCI_PASSWORD | Your Password |
| SPGCI_APPKEY | Your AppKey |

## Features

- Automatically generates token prior to making request.
- Returns data as a pandas DataFrame (set `raw=False` to get the raw `request.response` object).
- Can auto-paginate response and concatenates into a single DataFrame (set `paginate=True` to enable).
- Sets datatype for `date` and `datetime` fields in DataFrame.
- Composes nicely with native python/pandas types. Arguments support `lists` and `pd.Series` which are automatically converted into filter expressions.
