# eisenmp
 
Python 3.7 
[Multiprocessor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiprocessing)
[Framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework) for Server and Mobiles 

Forget about pools, swim in the sea.

Features:

* Create **uniform** multiprocess programs for your projects
* Calculate your Python generator output on _every_ CPU core
* Worker **module_loader** decouples your Worker imports from Main()
* **auto Exit** of worker and process
* Start methods, **spawn**, **fork** and **forkserver**
* Create VM_ware like **port groups** on CPU cores and stream with (tcp/http) maximum speed via selected NIC adapters
* Process **START_SEQUENCE_NUM** Worker on a CPU core can grab a specific queue 0=red_q, 1=blue_q,2=yellow_q
* **Categories of Queues**, read them with **all custom vars** in a worker **ToolBox** dictionary
* no libraries, light weight; (Linux, Windows)

Visit the features above in the
[Examples gitHub repository](https://github.com/44xtc44/eisenmp_examples), 
or get the [Examples PyPi package](https://pypi.org/project/eisenmp-examples/),
run 

    eisenmp_url 
    or 
    eisenmp_menu
simpleHTTP Ajax server, or terminal menu

All scenarios run on **reusable Template Modules**. Enjoy the descriptions and discover.

## How it works
You write two functions and two modules.
Let's call 'em **Generator.py** and **Worker.py**.

1. Generator.py starts a new process, _but_ the target is **module_loader.py** (loader).
2. loader imports your (independent) Worker.py module from file system. 
This makes sure that only imports of the worker.py module are loaded, without side effects.
3. loader sits in a loop and calls your Worker.py entry function endless. Until there is no more work in the queues.
This loop keeps the process alive.
4. **q_feeder** iterator sends a STOP Worker message with the last chunk. Your Worker reads STOP, return False and exit. 
5. The **module loader** then puts a STOP Worker message in all other input queues.
Loader runs idle and awaits the internal STOP Process message. **Next** Worker reads STOP, exit ...

Default ``six Queues``
- ``Input`` worker lists, ``Output`` result and stop lists, ``Process`` shutdown
- ``Tools``, ``Print``, ``Info``

### In detail:

Generator - iterator chunks on every CPU core:
- [Generator yield](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#yieldexpr)
or 
[(expression)](https://peps.python.org/pep-0289/)
output 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ➜ eisenmp iterator list [ [1,2] [3,4] [5] ] ➜ **NUM_ROWS** chunks for your Worker
- (A) Mngr(): Import and instantiate **eisenmp**. Register the worker in (also) a list. 
- (B) Mngr(): Assign Worker load and process count.
- (C) Mngr(): Call **iterator** run_q_feeder(generator=Mngr generator)
- (D) Wkr(): Loop over **NUM_ROWS** list chunks. Return False to **auto exit worker and process**, or get next chunk 
[Examples gitHub](https://github.com/44xtc44/eisenmp_examples)
or get the [PyPi package](https://pypi.org/project/eisenmp-examples/)

One Server (or more) on every CPU core:
- (A) Mngr(): Import and instantiate **eisenmp**. Register the worker module in a list.
- (D.1) Wkr(): The **worker** starts **ONE** server, blocks (run_forever on IP: foo port: 42) and serves whatever
- (D.2) Wkr(): The **worker** starts **MANY** server. Server start call must be threaded, set **STOP_MSG_DISABLE=True**
- Server read queues: Follow the Generator todo
[Examples gitHub](https://github.com/44xtc44/eisenmp_examples)
or get the [PyPi package](https://pypi.org/project/eisenmp-examples/)

Port groups:
- Map **START_SEQUENCE_NUM**'s ➜ to multiple (server) ports on CPU cores ➜ to an IP address, 
[Examples gitHub](https://github.com/44xtc44/eisenmp_examples)
or get the [PyPi package](https://pypi.org/project/eisenmp-examples/)


### ready to use:
- **run_q_feeder()** iterator lists get a **serial number** header to recreate the original order of chunks
- **mp_tools_q** for big tools stuff delivery to every single Worker proc module;
It may be a 27GB rainbow table; See the bruteforce (small) example, please
- Output **can** be stored if **RESULTS_STORE** is set in config


## Issues
eisenmp can run on Python 3.6 (Ubuntu test), but not the samples.

## How to run the examples?
Most easy is PyPi package mentioned above. **eisenmp** will be installed also.

Clone both repos.
[eisenmp](https://github.com/44xtc44/eisenmp) and
[eisenmp_examples](https://github.com/44xtc44/eisenmp_examples)

Install in editable pip mode.

    cd eisenmp 
    pip3 install -e .  # uninstall (linux pip3) with: pip3 uninstall eisenmp

    cd eisenmp_examples
    pip3 install -e .  # uninstall with: pip3 uninstall eisenmp_examples
Run the examples.
 
    eisenmp_url
    # or
    eisenmp_menu

    Inbuild example, assert a scrambled string. Use brute force or condensing.
    We use an english (.6M) plus a german (2M) wordlist and make a dictionary of it. To gain more read speed.
    (A) len(str) <=  11, combined brute force dictionary attack with a permutation generator. itertool prod. duplicates
        Permutation lists grow very fast, reaching Terabyte size.
    (B) len(str) >=  12, pre reduce a len(str) list. Kick out words which are not matching char type and count.

`eisenmp` uses Pythons permutation generator
 [itertools](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html?highlight=itertools.permutations#itertools.permutations)
for the brute force attack example.

    Another example downloads a large list and calculates average for one column.
    Python CSV extracts the column and we calculate the average with the assigned number
    of Porcesses/CPU cores. It can be more processes than CPU cores, if it makes sense.
