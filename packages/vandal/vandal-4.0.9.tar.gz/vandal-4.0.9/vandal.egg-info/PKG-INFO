        **For whom is vandal made for?**
        
        vandal is a Python library for Data science and Machine learning, designed to aid researchers and engineers to meet their goals with small effort.
        
        **Why vandal?**
        
        As a vandal gives abandoned walls meaning with graffiti, so does vandal library to the data.
        
        **Is vandal free to use?**
        
        vandal is completely free of charge for both personal and commercial use, but only under the conditions stated in the license. Developing such a complex library isn't easy and takes a lot of time and knowledge in several fields of science such as statistics, programming and domain knowledge, so any donation at https://patreon.com/dkundih or https://www.buymeacoffee.com/dkundih in order to keep vandal free is more than welcome.
        
        **A word from the author!**
        
        The library itself, it's maintenance, updates and stability, logo, videos, promotional materials and everything associated with duality are done by **David Kundih** from **Croatia**.
