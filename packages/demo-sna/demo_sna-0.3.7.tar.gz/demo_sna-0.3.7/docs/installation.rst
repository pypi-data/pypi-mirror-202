Installation
============


Stable release
--------------

To install demo, run this command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install demo

This is the preferred method to install demo, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have `pip`_ installed, this `Python installation guide`_ can guide
you through the process.

From sources
------------

The sources for demo can be downloaded from the `Github repo`_.

You can either clone the public repository:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone git://github.com/eng-aomar/demo

Or download the `tarball`_:

.. code-block:: console

    $ curl -OJL https://github.com/eng-aomar/demo/tarball/master

Once you have a copy of the source, you can install it with:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python setup.py install


.. _Github repo: https://github.com/eng-aomar/demo
