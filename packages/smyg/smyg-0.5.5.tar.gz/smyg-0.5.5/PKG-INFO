# ShowMeYourGit

**showmeyourgit** (or smyg) is a project for calculating git metrics: added lines, deleted lines, commits count, changed files, code changes ratio, code churn ratio.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install smyg.

```bash
pip install --user smyg
```

## Usage

Clone [example project](https://github.com/nmix/example-project)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nmix/example-project.git
cd example-project
```

### commit

 Show commit info

```bash
# --- show command help
$ smyg commit --help

# --- show last commit info for current branch
$ smyg commit
cdcb7c6ac0b92b1e16cfdd6f1e6abf0ed8f73e48 | update README

['main']
Added lines:       26
Deleted lines:      0
Changed files:      1

# --- show last commit info in json format
$ smyg commit --output json | jq

```

### branch-commits

Show changes for bundle of commits in branch.

If we know last commit of previous bundle then we take all commits after that. In Gitlab CI previous commit SHA may be in `CI_COMMIT_BEFORE_SHA` environment variable (see [Predefined variables reference](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/predefined_variables.html)).

If we dont have previous commit then we take only commits for *single* branch. *Signle* branch means that commit belongs only one branch. **Here it is mandatory to have a complete local copy of the repository with all branches.**

```bash
# --- show command help
$ smyg branch-commits --help

# --- if you just clone the example repository, the entire commit list will be displayed (from Initial commit)
#     this is because only one branch is locally received and all commits belongs to it
$ smyg branch-commits

### codechanges

Show total added and deleted lines count for current ref.

```bash
# --- show command help
$ smyg codechanges --help

# --- changes for current ref
$ smyg codechanges
Ratio (%):         11
Added lines:      107
Deleted lines:     12

# --- code changes between commits
$ smyg codechanges --from-commit 3a085582e8df7c1d622c412eb54eb5ee96e82c48  \
  --to-commit bbead3ba03de57909ee622fac4b973de180f5e5f
Ratio (%):         42
Added lines:       26
Deleted lines:     11
```

### codechurn

Show count of added lines and count of deleted lines from those that were added. Displays the level of work that was not released.

> Ideally, it should coincide with the codechanges for whole project history. For complex branching it may slightly different.

```bash
# --- show command help
$ smyg codechurn --help

# --- churn for current ref (equal with codechanges, it is expected)
smyg codechurn
Ratio (%):         11
Added lines:      107
Deleted lines:     12

# --- churn from specified commit (not equal with codechanges, it is expected)
$ smyg codechurn --from-commit 44c6334f38fe796f38c39e1d11a8d19925684926 \
    --to-commit fccfa86625353409018ccd467f0050b57152656e
Ratio (%):         23
Added lines:       26
Deleted lines:      6
```

## Prometheus Metrics

You can push metrics to Prometheus PushGateway. 
Recommended to use Aggregation Gateway like https://github.com/zapier/prom-aggregation-gateway.

`commit` and `branch_commits` is a *Counter* type, `codechanges` and `codechurn` - *Gauge*. 

You must specify environment variables `PUSHGATEWAY_URL` and `PROJECT_NAME` and command option `--push-metrics` to send metrics. For basic auth access specify `PUSHGATEWAY_USERNAME` and `PUSHGATEWAY_PASSWORD`.

```bash
$ git checkout main

$ docker run --rm -p 8080:80 ghcr.io/zapier/prom-aggregation-gateway:v0.7.0

$ PUSHGATEWAY_URL=localhost:8080 PROJECT_NAME=example_project \
    smyg commit --push-metrics
