flakeheaven is a python linter built around flake8 to enable inheritable and complex toml configuration.

This project is a fork of [FlakeHell](https://github.com/life4/flakehell). FlakeHell and other forks of it such as
flakehell/flakehell are [no longer maintained](https://github.com/flakehell/flakehell/issues/25) and do not work with Flake8 4.0.x.

FlakeHeaven works with Flake8 4.0.1 or greater. This fork will be [maintained by the community](https://github.com/flakeheaven/flakeheaven/discussions/1) that developed the existing forks.

## Compatibility

FlakeHeaven supports all flake8 plugins, formatters, and configs. However, FlakeHeaven has its own beautiful way to configure enabled plugins and codes. So, options like `--ignore` and `--select` are unsupported. You can have flake8 and FlakeHeaven in one project if you want but enabled plugins should be explicitly specified.

## Installation

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user flakeheaven
```

## Usage

First of all, let's create `pyproject.toml` config:

```toml
[tool.flakeheaven]
# optionally inherit from remote config (or local if you want)
base = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flakeheaven/flakeheaven/main/pyproject.toml"
# specify any flake8 options. For example, exclude "example.py":
exclude = ["example.py"]
# make output nice
format = "grouped"
# 80 chars aren't enough in 21 century
max_line_length = 90
# show line of source code in output
show_source = true

# list of plugins and rules for them
[tool.flakeheaven.plugins]
# include everything in pyflakes except F401
pyflakes = ["+*", "-F401"]
# enable only codes from S100 to S199
flake8-bandit = ["-*", "+S1??"]
# enable everything that starts from `flake8-`
"flake8-*" = ["+*"]
# explicitly disable plugin
flake8-docstrings = ["-*"]
```

Show plugins that aren't installed yet:

```bash
flakeheaven missed
```

Show installed plugins, used plugins, specified rules, codes prefixes:

```bash
flakeheaven plugins
```

![plugins command output](./assets/plugins.png)

Show codes and messages for a specific plugin:

```bash
flakeheaven codes pyflakes
```

![codes command output](./assets/codes.png)

Run flake8 against the code:

```bash
flakeheaven lint
```

This command accepts all the same arguments as Flake8.

## Contributing

1. Add tests when possible (eg for features / fixes / refactor, etc. )
2. Add your contribution to the code / docs
3. Ensure your code passes all (both original and your own) tests.
4. Commit using [proper header](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
5. Create a PR

Contributions are welcome! A few ideas where you can contribute:

+ Improve documentation.
+ Add more tests.
+ Improve performance.
+ Found a bug? Fix it!
+ Made an article about FlakeHeaven? Great! Let's add it into the `README.md`.
+ Don't have time to code? No worries! Just tell your friends and subscribers about the project. More users -> more contributors -> more cool features.

A convenient way to run tests is using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/master/#installing-with-the-official-installer):

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
poetry install
poetry run pytest tests
```

Thank you :heart:
