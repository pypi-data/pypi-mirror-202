# Logging for python based Robocorp projects

Logging focused on RPA projects for Robocorp robots.

> Note: The current version is still pre-alpha and the [format specified](/docs/format.md) may still change.

## Why

Although the python logging is flexible it may be hard to analyze the logging afterwards and
provide a nice representation. Also, the format may end up using a big amount of disk space.

`robocorp-logging` improves those aspects by using a structured format which enables using less disk space
while also providing a viewer for the generated content.

Also, it provides utilities to setup logging so that logging is done automatically without having
to explicitly add calls to add content to the logging (although it's still possible to do so
when needed).


### Installation

Install with:

`pip install robocorp-logging`


## Dealing with sensitive data in the logs
