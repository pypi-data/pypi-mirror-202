# QBI University of Manchester contribution to DCE code collection
This is a limited upload of the QbiPy package that can be installed from PyPI
(*ie* calling `pip install QbiPy`), with the original source code available
[here](https://gitlab.com/manchester_qbi/manchester_qbi_public/QbiPy).

I am happy to copy over the full package, but for now have just applied the parts
that align with our current collection targets.

This is a simple example script in the examples folder showing how to get
started with dce_models.tofts_model module. The other model modules are
set up in the same way as the tofts_model.

Note I don't use this code to fit models, it is mainly used to provide
auxiliarry functionality to the Madym C++ toolbox, but I hope it is a useful
contribution nonetheless.

Please contact @michaelberks if you have any questions.
