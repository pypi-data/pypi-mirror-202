# Components

## Categories

The following component categories are available in _Toolkit_.

#### Layout

Components to organise the app's layout. Not meaningful by themselves; their objective is to enhance how other components are presented.

#### Content

Components that present content and are meaningful by themselves. For example, charts, images or text.

#### Input

Components whose main objective is to allow the user to input data into the app. Most of these components can be grouped into a _Form_ to receive and process their values all at once.

#### Other

These components, _HTML Element_, _Repeater_ and _Timer_, occupy a special role and are discussed separately below.

_Root_ and _Page_ are also components with their own category, but not available in _Toolkit_.
