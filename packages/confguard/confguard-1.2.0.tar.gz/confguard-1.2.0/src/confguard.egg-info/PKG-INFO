# confguard

> Save sensitive configuration files outside project in save place.

Simple tool to manage sensitive configuration files outside of a project.

**Guard** project by moving sensitive files/directories to a safe place
where they can be handled properly. Symlinks replace them.

- Un-guarding restores original state.
- State is being kept in ``.confguard`` file.
