# NOTE: Draft version
# TODO: Decouple default key/attribute values from metadata.
#
# Absolutely every key/attribute in the config file is an instance of the "entry" structure
# It always has 3 implicit system attributes: _required/_default/_type with following default values:
# _required: true
# _default: NULL
# _type: string
#
# For example, just presence of some "key:" entry in the file means that this "key" is mandatory (_required = true)
# and has _type = "string" datatype and _default = "NULL" as a value
#
# Mentioned _required/_default/_type attributes are reserved.
# entry:
#   _required: true
#   _default: null
#   _type:
#     - empty
#     - boolean
#     - string
#     - number
#     - array
#     - map
#
# It's not advisable to introduce custom keys with leading underscore symbol "_token"
# If some entry starts with underscore it's considered as variable defining substitution block for future use
# As result, it is ignored in the parsed output
# Please see "_fdw_name" entry for details
