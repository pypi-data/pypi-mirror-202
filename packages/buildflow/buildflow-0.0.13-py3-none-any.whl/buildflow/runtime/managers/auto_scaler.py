"""Auto-scaler used by the stream manager.

When we do scale up?
    We check the backlog of the current source, and compare it to the
    throughput since the last autoscale event we request the number of replicas
    required to burn down the entire backlog in 60 seconds.

When do we scale down?
    First we check that we don't need to scale up. If we don't need to scale
    up, we check what the current utilization of our replicas is above 50%.
    The utilization is determined by the number of non-empty requests for data
    were made.
