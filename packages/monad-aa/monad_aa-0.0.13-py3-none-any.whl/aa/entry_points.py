this file contains the entry points of this monad.
an interactor is a function that responds to business commands and
business events.

typically UI applications (or CLI) invokes commands.
the monad responds to the commands by performing business logic.
the monad returns a response to the caller.
the monad could emit business events.
finally, monad could respond to business events.

monad is a fundamental unit of business functionality.
monad is self-sufficient and contains all the necessary "brains" to perform the business functionality.
monad has all the intelligence to bring microservice to life.
just add an infrastructure to monad and you get microservice.

monad should never invoke another monad's command (anti-pattern)
