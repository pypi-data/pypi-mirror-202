## Overview

Interactive Score Editor is a python library that helps bridge a music notation library (such as Lilypond via Abjad(https://abjad.github.io/index.html) to an audio player (such as pydub). The goal is to resolve the following: "Abjad provides no audio output beyond LilyPond’s built-in MIDI functionality" (https://abjad.github.io/first_steps/audience.html). Using LilyPond's MIDI is will take longer and be more complicated than a built in feature to play notes directly.

A successful implementation will be helpful both for individuals creating music-composition tools / applications, as well as individuals looking to play around with music composition and sound in a notebook, and will cut the time from starting a music project to hearing actual sound (an element which has been a personal annoyance).

# Installation

Prerequisites:
* Python >=3.7,
* lilypond, portaudio
* numpy, pyaudio, midiutil, ipython, pygame

To install python packages:
```bash
$ pip install numpy
$ pip install pyaudio
$ pip install midiutil
$ pip install ipython
$ pip install pygame
```

Lilypond (https://lilypond.org) and portaudio (http://www.portaudio.com) can be installed from their websites, with brew
```
$ brew install lilypond
$ brew install portaudio
```
or with apt
```
# sudo apt install portaudio19-dev python3-pyaudio
# sudo apt install -y lilypond
```

Ensure that lilypond runs from the command line by running 
```bash
$ lilypond --version
```

# Quick start example

For now, ensure you have a folder named `temp` in the current directory in order to ensure functinality of getScore() (this will be amended in a future release)
```python
import importlib  
ise = importlib.import_module("interactive-score-editor.src.Base")
Piece = ise.Piece
p1 = Piece(60, "3/4")
p1.addVoice("e' f' g'", 4)
p1.addVoice("c'4 d'4 e'4 f'4 g'4 a'4 b'4 c''4 b'4 c''2.")
p1.play()
p1.getScore()
```

The above example demonstrates the primary functionality of the piece object; the ability to play and display notes using the same object.
