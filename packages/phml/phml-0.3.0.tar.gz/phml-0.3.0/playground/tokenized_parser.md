### Open Tag
- Open tag is `<` maybe followed by `!` then a name like `html` with no spaces.
- After the first space the attributes are a list of tokens of format `<name> = "<value>"` or `<name> = '<value>'` or `<name> = <value>` or `<name>`. Key symbol is `=` an then what is the next non whitespace char. `"`, `'` are quoted blocks, otherwise it is any non whitespace characters. If a space is present and no `=` then just the name exists.
- The open tag ends with a `>`.
- There can be any amount of whitespace. Whitespace only matters for starting the attributes and for attribute values not wrapped in quotes.
- Open tags can end with `/` or can be automatically self closing
- Name can be only whitespace or empty. This tag can not have attributes

### Close Tag
- Closes the current opened scope.
- Starts with `/` and the name of the tag it is closing. Must match current scope and no whitespace.
- No attributes

### General
- pre tags make all children retain whitespace
- each token contains a position range of where it is in the string regardless of if it is in a file or not
