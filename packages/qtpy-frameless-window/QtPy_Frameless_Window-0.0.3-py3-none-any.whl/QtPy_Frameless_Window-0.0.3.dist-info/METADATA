A cross-platform frameless window based on QtPy.

</div>

This repo is based on *QtPy* and [PyQt-Frameless-Window](https://github.com/zhiyiYo/PyQt-Frameless-Window). Due to library in diffrent *PyQt-Frameless-Window* branches cannot exist in one virtual environment, I created this repository by adding *QtPy* dependence and modifying some modules. This repo will keep up with *PyQt-Frameless-Window*.

## Install
To install use pip:
```shell
pip install QtPy-Frameless-Window
```
Or clone the repo:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/TaoChenyue/QtPy-Frameless-Window.git
python setup.py install
```

## Usage
According to QtPy, environment argument ```QT_API``` must be set before import qtpy. Here provides an easy way to set it.

```python
from qt_api import set_qt_api
# set through code
set_qt_api("pyqt5")
python examples/demo.py 
# set through sys.argv
set_qt_api(parse=True)
python examples/demo.py --api pyside6
```
If no QT_API is set, qtpy will use pyqt5 as default.

```python
from qt_api import set_qt_api
set_qt_api("pyqt5")
from qtpy.QtWidgets import QApplication
from qtframelesswindow import FramelessWindow

class Window(FramelessWindow):
    def __init__(self, parent=None):
        super().__init__(parent=parent)
        self.setWindowTitle("QtPy-Frameless-Window")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = QApplication([])
    demo = Window()
    demo.show()
    app.exec_()
```

## FQ
+ Q: Why acrylic window response slowly when dragging its edge on Windows platform?<br>
A: Reference to https://www.cnblogs.com/zhiyiYo/p/14659981.html, change settings.
