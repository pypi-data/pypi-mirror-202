A cross-platform frameless window based on QtPy.

</div>

This repo is based on *QtPy* and [PyQt-Frameless-Window](https://github.com/zhiyiYo/PyQt-Frameless-Window). Due to library in diffrent *PyQt-Frameless-Window* branches cannot exist in one virtual environment, I created this repository by adding *QtPy* dependence and modifying some modules. This repo will keep up with *PyQt-Frameless-Window*.

## Install
To install use pip:
```shell
pip install QtPy-Frameless-Window
```
Or clone the repo:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/TaoChenyue/QtPy-Frameless-Window.git
python setup.py install
```
