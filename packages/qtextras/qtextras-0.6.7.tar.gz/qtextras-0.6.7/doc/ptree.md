# Parameter Tree-based Controller
A utility that automatically turns function arguments into parameters, similar to
the `interact` capabilities of `ipywidgets`. Unlike the latter, though, this works
natively within Qt and doesn't need a notebook / js integration to render. Also,
it's much faster and gives a bit more granularity over parameter access.

A decorator, `interact()`, takes all function parameters with default arguments
and creates pyqtgraph Parameters out of them, inferring type either (a) by the
default type or (b) by the function documentation. These can be seen in the example
code found [here](../qtextras/examples/ParameterEditor.py).

More complex usage is showcased by the [imgcropper](https://gitlab.com/ntjess/imgcropper)
project.
