# astronomica

## Astronomica Usage Exampe
<b>Astronomica</b> is a simple python library based on formulas pioneered at https://www.aa.quae.nl/en/reken/zonpositie.html, and https://astronomica.w3spaces.com/. Scroll below to check out the documentation.

### Note of Usage:
<b>Astronomica is 100% free</b>!! It is also <b>driven by the <i>community</i></b>, so we welcome tips, bug fixes, and more methods added by users and the general python & astronomy community.


## Usage:
Here is a very simple usage example of Astronomica:

```python

from astronomica import *

lunar_phase = getLunarPhase()
planting_time = False
if lunar_phase == 'Full':
  planting_time = True
  sendNotificationToFarmers("It is a full Moon, planting should begin")
else:
  waitForFullMoon()

```

## Methods

```python
local_julian_date(date=datetime.datetime.now())
```

This method returns the current local <b>julian date</b>


```python
fromJulian(j) # j is the julian date to convert
```

This method returns the gregorian date <b> from </b> a given julian date

```python
get_lunar_age()
```

This method returns the current age of the moon (in days)

```python
get_lunar_age_percent()
```

This method returns the current percentage of the lunar cycle completed by the moon

```python
getLunarPhase()
```

This method returns the current lunar phase

```python
daysSinceJ2000()
```


This method returns the days since Jan 1st 2000 Epoch

```python
sun = Sun(lat, long)
sun.get_local_sunrise_time()
sun.get_local_sunset_time()
```

These methods return the sunrise and sunset time


```python
decimalHours(now) # now is the chosen time
```

This method returns the decimal hours for a given time

```python
localSiderealTime(long)
```

This method returns the local sidereal time for a given longitude <b>east</b>

```python
altitude(lat, long)
```

This method returns the current solar altitude on earth for a given longitude <b>east</b> and a latitude <b>north</b>

```python
azimuth(lat, long)
```

This method returns the current solar azimuth in degrees for a given latitude and longitude <b>east</b>

```python
map_star(star)
```

This method returns the type of star based on its name. 

## Observer Class

```
observer = Observer(lat, long, desired_planet_for_calculations, date=datetime.datetime.now())
```

### Methods in class

```python
julian_date()
```

returns the current julian date

```python
mean_anomaly()
```

returns the mean anomaly of the chosen planet specified when initializing the object (see the initialization for details)

```python
equation_of_center()
```

returns the current equation of center to correct the mean anomaly of the planet.

```python
true_anomaly()
```

returns the true anomaly of the chosen planet

```python
set_perihelion_and_obliquity()
```

sets the longitude of the perihelion of the planet's orbit, and its obliquity

```python
ecliptical_longitude()
```

returns the ecliptical longitude of the sun

```python
equatorial_coordinates()
```

returns the equatorial coordinates of the sun from the planet (right ascension and declination) as a dictionary. 


```python
local_solar_transit()
```

returns the solar noon julian date for the current day. It can be converted to regular time by fromJulian(j) function

```python
distance_to_sun()
```

returns the distance to the sun from that planet.

```python
planet_heliocentric_coordinates()
```

returns the planets rectangular ecliptical heliocentric coordinates (x, y, z)
