|PROJECT_NAME|: |SHORT_DESCRIPTION|
===================================



Installation
============

This project is published
on the `Python Package Index (PyPI) <https://pypi.org/>`_
at: |PYPI_PROJECT_URL|_.
It should be installable from Python distribution platforms or Integrated Development Environments (IDEs).
Otherwise, it can be installed from a command console:

- For all users, after acquiring administrative rights:
    - First installation: ``pip install`` |PYPI_NAME_LITERAL|
    - Installation update: ``pip install --upgrade`` |PYPI_NAME_LITERAL|
- For the current user (no administrative rights required):
    - First installation: ``pip install --user`` |PYPI_NAME_LITERAL|
    - Installation update: ``pip install --user --upgrade`` |PYPI_NAME_LITERAL|



Documentation
=============

SKLGraph Pipeline: 2-D/3-D Object Map -> Object Skeleton -> SKeLeton Graph -> Graph Features

The documentation is available through a crude, automatically generated, index page at |DOCUMENTATION_URL|_.

.. note::
   In the context of this project, ``pdoc3`` appears to be better at formatting the modules and functions documentation, but does not provide inter-module navigation, while ``pydoctor`` fails to correctly format certain documentation aspects, but offers structured, inter-module navigation (look for the ``index`` link in the ``pydoctor`` section).



Acknowledgments
===============

The project is developed with `PyCharm Community <https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/>`_.

The development relies on several open-source packages
(see ``install_requires`` in ``setup.py``, if present; otherwise ``import`` statements should be searched for).

The code is formatted by `Black <https://github.com/psf/black/>`_, *The Uncompromising Code Formatter*.

The imports are ordered by `isort <https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort/>`_... *your imports, so you don't have to*.

The API documentations are automatically generated by:

- `pdoc3 <https://pdoc3.github.io/pdoc>`_, *Auto-generate API documentation for Python projects*.

- `pydoctor <https://github.com/twisted/pydoctor>`_, *an API documentation generator that works by static analysis*.
