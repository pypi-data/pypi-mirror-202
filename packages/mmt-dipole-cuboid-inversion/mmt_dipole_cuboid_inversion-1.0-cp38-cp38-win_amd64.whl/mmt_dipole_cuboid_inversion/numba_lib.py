    Main function to populate the G matrix

    Notes
    -----
    The outer while loop will last until reaching the total number of cuboids
    in the sample. Adjacent cuboids belong to a single particle, which is
    indexed in the 6th element of the cuboids array. The population of the `G`
    matrix is performed column wise for every particle. For each cuboid
    belonging to a particle, their contribution to the magnetic flux is summed
    up for every sensor measurement in steps of `delta_*` in the xy plane,
    which are given by the loops with the `i-j` indexes. The flux is stored
    column wise.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G
        Reference to the forward matrix (np array) to be populated
    scan_domain
        Array of size 2x2 with the lower left and upper right coordinates of
        the scan surface

        If positive, z is oriented upwards, and grains are defined with
        negative z-values. If negative, z is oriented towards depth and grains
        are defined with positive z-values
    Origin
        If True the scan data is set to the QDM lower left corner coordinates.
        If False, the scan data origin is set at (0., 0.)
