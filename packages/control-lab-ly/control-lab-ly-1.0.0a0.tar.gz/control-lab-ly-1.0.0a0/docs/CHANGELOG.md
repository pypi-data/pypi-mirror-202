# Change Log

## Unreleased
*Items under development*

## 0.0.4.x
Introduced control for Peltier device and TriContinent Series C syringe pumps. First released 10 Mar 2023.
### Added
#### 0.0.4
- Added control for `Peltier`
  - set and get temperatures
  - hold temperatures for desired duration
  - checks if target temperature has been reached by checking power level lower than a threshold or time passed over a predefined duration, once the temperature is within tolerance
  - ability to record temperatures and timestamps 
- Added control for `TriContinent` and `TriContinentEnsemble`
  - single actions such as `empty`, `fill`, `initialise`, move actions, set speeds and valves, and wait
  - compound actions such as `aspirate`, `dispense`, and `prime`

### Changed
#### 0.0.4
- Update documentation

## 0.0.3.x
Minor changes to movement robot safety and pipette control. Introduced control for LED array. First released 08 Mar 2023.
### Added
#### 0.0.3
- Added safety measures for movement actions
  - In `Deck`, added exclusion zones when reading the `layout.json` file and new method `is_excluded()` to check if target coordinate is within the exclusion zone
  - In `Mover`, update `isFeasible()` method to check if target coordinates violates the deck's exclusion zone
  - New function `set_safety()` defines safety modes when starting a new session to pause for input (in "high" safety setting) and to wait for safety countdown (in "low" safety setting)
- `Make.Light.LEDArray` for controlling LEDs in the photo-reactor, as well as timing the LED "on" durations

### Changed
#### 0.0.3.1
- Update documentation
#### 0.0.3
- `Sartorius`
  - made the blowout/home optional for the dispense method upon emptying the pipette

## 0.0.2.x
Updates in setting up configuration files. First released 24 Feb 2023.
### Added
#### 0.0.2.2
- Added import of `CompoundSetup` class
#### 0.0.2
- `Deck.at()` method for directly referencing slots using either index numbers or names
