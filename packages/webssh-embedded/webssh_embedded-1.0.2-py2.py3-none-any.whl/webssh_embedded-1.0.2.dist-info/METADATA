webssh_embedded
-----------------

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

An interactive embedded web terminal built upon Shengdun Hua's original webssh package.

Features
~~~~~~~~

-  An Embedded terminal(using iframe).
-  Text input to enter commands to be executed in the remote machine.
-  Visualize the execution status of the command through color change and also the time taken to execute the command.
-  Database to keep track of executed commands.
-  Feature to allow commands to execute in case of webpage reload/refresh events and obtain the status and time for such commands.
-  Thorough logging to keep track of all events: both on browser's console and server side. An additional file called log.txt is created to log the terminal session.
-  Prevent empty commands from getting executed.
-  Prevent user from entering command while a comand is executing.
-  Commands can also be executed inside tmux, screen or script sessions.
-  A database setup file has been included in this project's GitHub repo to easily configure the database.

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Python 3.8+
-  MySQL database must be installed on the system where this package is installed. Also make sure root can access without password.
-  The project is optimized for remote machines running Linux. Hence this package will not work for remote machines with non Linux OS.
-  SSH service running on the remote machine to connect to.
-  Commands entered through text input must not run continuously like vi, tmux, screen etc.

Quickstart
~~~~~~~~~~

1. Install this app, run command ``pip install webssh_embedded``
2. Start a webserver, run command ``wssh --xsrf=False``
3. Open your browser, navigate to ``127.0.0.1:8888/static/js/iframetest.html``
4. The UI will appear with the embedded terminal at the bottom displaying a form to enter the SSH credentials. Fill the form. After successful login, you can enter commands through the text input and click on the submit message function.
