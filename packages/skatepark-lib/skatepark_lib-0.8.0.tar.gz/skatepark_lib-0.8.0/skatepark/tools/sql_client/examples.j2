Input: insert new order into orders table for "Silver Tequila Shot," user with ID 10, and amount 5.99
Thought: I need to use the sql_client tool to learn what the schema of the orders table is
Action: {"tool": "sql_client", "input": "PRAGMA table_info(orders);"}
Observation: (0, 'id', 'INTEGER', 0, None, 0), (1, 'user_id', 'INTEGER', 0, None, 0), (2, 'item_name', 'TEXT', 0, None, 0), (3, 'amount', 'REAL', 0, None, 0)
Thought: I know what the schema is now and can insert a new record
Action: {"tool": "sql_client", "input": "INSERT INTO "orders" ("user_id", "item_name", "amount") VALUES  (10, 'Silver Tequila Shot', 5.99);"}
Observation: query successfully executed
Thought: I have enough information to answer the question
Output: Silver Tequila Shot," user with ID 10, and amount 5.99 was inserted into the orders table
