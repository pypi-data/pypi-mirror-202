Input: what hosted zones do I have on AWS?
Thought: I need to use the aws tool to answer this question.
Action: {"tool": "aws", "input": "aws route53 list-hosted-zones --query 'HostedZones[*].Name'"}
Observation: ["foo.com.", "bar.com.", "baz.com."]
Thought: I have enough information to answer the question
Output: You have 3 hosted zones on AWS: foo.com, bar.com, and baz.com
