              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
        
              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"

[**PyGWalker**](https://github.com/Kanaries/pygwalker) can simplify your Jupyter Notebook data analysis and data visualization workflow, by turning your pandas dataframe (and polars dataframe) into a Tableau-style User Interface for visual exploration.

**PyGWalker** (pronounced like "Pig Walker", just for fun) is named as an abbreviation of "**Py**thon binding of **G**raphic **Walker**". It integrates Jupyter Notebook (or other jupyter-based notebooks) with [Graphic Walker](https://github.com/Kanaries/graphic-walker), a different type of open-source alternative to Tableau. It allows data scientists to analyze data and visualize patterns with simple drag-and-drop operations.

> PyGWalker will add more support such as R in the future.

## Setup pygwalker

Before using pygwalker, make sure to install the packages through the command line using pip or conda.

### pip

```bash
pip install pygwalker
```
> **Note**
> 
> For an early trial, you can install with `pip install pygwalker --upgrade` to keep your version up to date with the latest release or even `pip install pygwaler --upgrade --pre` to obtain latest features and bug-fixes.

### Conda-forge
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge pygwalker
```
or
```bash
mamba install -c conda-forge pygwalker
```
See [conda-forge feedstock](https://github.com/conda-forge/pygwalker-feedstock) for more help.

## Configuration

Since `pygwalker>=0.1.7a0`, we provide the ability to ability to modify user-wide configuration either through the command line interface
```bash
$ pygwalker config   
usage: pygwalker config [-h] [--set [key=value ...]] [--reset [key ...]] [--reset-all] [--list]

Modify configuration file.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --set [key=value ...]
                        Set configuration. e.g. "pygwalker config --set privacy=get-only"
  --reset [key ...]     Reset user configuration and use default values instead. e.g. "pygwalker config --reset privacy"
  --reset-all           Reset all user configuration and use default values instead. e.g. "pygwalker config --reset-all"
  --list                List current used configuration.
```
or through Python API
```python
>>> import pygwalker as pyg, pygwalker.utils.config as pyg_conf
>>> help(pyg_conf.set_config)

Help on function set_config in module pygwalker.utils.config:

set_config(config: dict, save=False)
    Set configuration.
    
    Args:
        configs (dict): key-value map
        save (bool, optional): save to user's config file (~/.config/pygwalker/config.json). Defaults to False.
(END)
```

### Privacy Policy
```bash
$ pygwalker config --set
usage: pygwalker config [--set [key=value ...]] | [--reset [key ...]].

Available configurations:
- privacy        ['offline', 'get-only', 'meta', 'any'] (default: meta).
    "offline"   : no data will be transfered other than the front-end and back-end of the notebook.
    "get-only"  : the data will not be uploaded but only fetched from external servers.
    "meta"      : only the desensitized data will be processed by external servers. There might be some server-side processing tasks performed on the metadata in future versions.
    "any"       : the data can be processed by external services.
```

For example,
```bash
pygwalker config --set privacy=meta
```
in command line and
```python
import pygwalker as pyg, pygwalker.utils.config as pyg_conf
pyg_conf.set_config( { 'privacy': 'meta' }, save=True)
```
have the same effect.

## Use pygwalker in Jupyter Notebook

Import pygwalker and pandas to your Jupyter Notebook to get started.

```python    
import pandas as pd
import pygwalker as pyg
```

You can use pygwalker without breaking your existing workflow. For example, you can call up Graphic Walker with the dataframe loaded in this way:

```python
df = pd.read_csv('./bike_sharing_dc.csv', parse_dates=['date'])
gwalker = pyg.walk(df)
```

And you can use pygwalker with polars (since `pygwalker>=0.1.4.7a0`):
```python
import polars as pl
df = pl.read_csv('./bike_sharing_dc.csv',try_parse_dates = True)

Cool things you can do with Graphic Walker:

+ You can change the mark type into others to make different charts, for example, a line chart:

+ To compare different measures, you can create a concat view by adding more than one measure into rows/columns.

+ To make a facet view of several subviews divided by the value in dimension, put dimensions into rows or columns to make a facets view. The rules are similar to Tableau.
