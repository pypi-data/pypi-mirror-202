# Description
The Netonix® WISP Switches provide a WebAPI as backend for their webinterface. This python script allows to access this API directly.


to change configuration, you need to fetch the full configuration first, change it and push it back up:
```
from netonix_api import Netonix

	n=Netonix()
	n.open(ip,user,pw)
	n.getConfig()
	n.config['Switch_Name']="Switch-55"
	n.putConfig()

```
