# vectordbs

Vectordbs is a python library that supports all vector databases specifically for LLM apps and frameworks.

Currently all LLM frameworks and apps (Llama-Index, Open AI, Langchain, Baby AGI, etc) are all having to reimplement support for each vector database with a lot of redundant work, and this library is hoping to existing and new frameworks don't have to reinvent the wheel.
