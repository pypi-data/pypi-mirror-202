## Introduction

Clara is an AI-powered tool designed to assist developers in navigating unfamiliar code repositories, making it highly valuable during the on-boarding process for new projects, or when deciphering legacy code..

In the future, Clara will also provide support for tasks such as documentation, auditing, and developing new features, among others.
