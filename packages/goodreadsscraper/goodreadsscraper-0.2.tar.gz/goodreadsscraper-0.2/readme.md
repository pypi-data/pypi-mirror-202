# GoodReadsScraper

This package aims to provide a program to scrape from the book repository goodreads, authors,books and their reviews information.  
It allows for single or multiple requests at a time, with the aim of creating review datasets.  
As goodreads is a highly dinamyc website, simple requests are not realiable enough to gather information, as such, a webdriver is necessary, provided by the selenium package. It is recommended to have firefox with geckodriver installed

## Review Scraping
Scraping a book's reviews, single or multiple reviews at a time, gathering information such as the score given, the reviewer, the review,etc.  
Needs to be used paired with a book option described above.  
Can gather only the firts reviews of the review page, or make use of the dynamic options of the page to show more reviews and gather them.  

### Options:
- rs :  
Reviews simple, gather only the first reviews available in the book's review page (max 30).

- r :  
Reviews, gather all the reviews available in the book's review page (if there are many reviews this will be very slow and resource heavy as the single web page is being updated with more information).

- rg :  
Reviews range, gather reviews only in a certain range. E.g. [0,100], gathers review 0 to 100 if possible.

- rl :  
Reviews language, uses the language given to filter reviews on the page if such an option is found, otherwise no reviews are gathered.

- ro :  
Reviews output, defines an output file for the reviews to be written. If using the json option and there is a book with no review output defined, the global review output will be used, allowing for appending reviews from multiple books in a single file. If no output is given, reviews will be written to stdout.

### Usage:

- grs -btitle 'Watership Down' -a 'Richard Adams' -r -rg 0 100 -rl en  
 *Searching for the first 100 english reviews of *Watership Down*

## Extras

 - o:  
 Output file for both author and book information.

 Logging option. Logs about the proceding of the program, written on stdout, recommended as the tasks can be lengthy and this gives information about their progress and helps notice if it is stuck.

 - j:  
 Json file that allows for giving multiple iterations of the program to be given at once. This follows the format:  
---

    {
        "books": [
            {
                "name" : "Coraline",
                "author" : "Neil Gaiman", 
                "output" : "coraline.txt",
                "reviews" : true,
                "reviews_output" : "caroline_reviews.csv",
                "reviews_range" : [40,60],
                "reviews_language" : "pt"

            }
        ],
        "authors" : [
            {
                "name" : "abel ferreira",
                "output" : "abel.txt"
            }
        ]
}

Where the first key *books* represents all the books that are meant to be scraped. Each book can have its task costumized to only search for the basic info, its output, gather reviews in a range and so on. The flags explained before are also available here in the same contexts, whereas in this case their full name has to be given, as exemplefied, for ease of legibility (special case for 'btitle' and 'a' which both are recognized as 'name').  
As mentioned before, if a book does not have a review output defined, they will either go to the default output or, if a global review output is given with the flag **-ro**, they will be appended there.

- e:  
Error output file

- ve:  
Verbose option. Writes full information for a given author or book, this is, their description or works list.

- V:  
Shows the program version.
