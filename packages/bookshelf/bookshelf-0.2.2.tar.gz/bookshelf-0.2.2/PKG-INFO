``bookshelf`` is how Climate Resource reuses datasets across projects


The ``bookshelf`` represents a shared collection of curated datasets or ``Books``. Each
``Book`` is a preprocessed, versioned dataset including the notebooks used to produce it.
As the underlying datasets or processing are updated, new ``Books`` can be created (with
an updated version). A single dataset may produce multiple ``Resources`` if different
representations are useful. These ``Books`` can be deployed to a shared ``Bookshelf`` so
that they are accessible by other users.

Users are able to use specific ``Books`` within other projects. The dataset and associated
metadata is fetched and cached locally. Specific versions of ``Books`` can also be pinned for
reproducibility purposes.

This repository contains the notebooks that are used to generate the ``Books``
as well as a CLI tool for managing these datasets.

This is a prototype and will likely change in future
