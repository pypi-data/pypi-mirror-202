# g36-ahu-faults

[![Build Status](https://app.travis-ci.com/bbartling/g36-ahu-faults.svg?branch=develop)](https://app.travis-ci.com/bbartling/g36-ahu-faults)

## This project is under development to eventually be a Pypi package for Fault Detection Diagnostics (FDD) on HVAC system datasets with the Pandas computing library. 
See also (in development) for other HVAC system types:
* [g36-boiler-plant-faults](https://github.com/bbartling/g36-boiler-plant-faults)
* [g36-chiller-plant-faults](https://github.com/bbartling/g36-chiller-plant-faults)

###### Note - Fault equations expect a float between 0.0 and 1.0 for a control system analog output that is typically expressed in industry HVAC controls as a percentage between 0 and 100% of command. 
Examples of a analog output could a heating valve, air damper, or fan VFD speed. For sensor input data these can be either float or integer based. Boolean on or off data for control system 
binary commands the fault equation expects an integer of 0 for Off and 1 for On.
