0.1.10 (06/09/2021)
------------------
- Fixing issue involving frequency bands. 

0.1.9 (05/05/2021)
------------------
- Adding custom input percentage threshold for spectral entropy, power spectrum and shannon entropy.
- Updating DTF to generate directed graphs. 

0.1.8 (05/04/2021)
------------------

- Rescaling data for Corrected cross-correlation. 

0.1.7 (04/22/2021)
------------------
- Updating Entropy depedency to Antropy, all dependencies are now installed with pip. 
- Updating np.complex to complex, deprecation warning numpy 1.20.

0.1.6 (03/25/2021)
------------------
- Adding the option to include a electrode montage file for channel labels, in method load_data(). 
- Adding warning if a channel label is not a recognize electrode position, it will be ignored for visualization. 

0.1.5 (02/26/2021)
------------------
- Fixing issue with spectral entropy that returned empty graph, when the top 25% top values are the same.
