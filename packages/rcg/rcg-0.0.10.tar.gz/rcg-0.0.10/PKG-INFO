# Rapid catchment generator
Tool for rapid prototyping of a hydraulic model that can be read and edited with SWMM.
The generator was created using feature analysis and surface runoff research from the literature. 
Fuzzy logic controller rules were developed using parameterized categories of soil, slope, 
and permeability. The catchment configuration procedure was simplified by mapping typical 
storage and Manning's coefficients. The use of fuzzy logic rules allows the system to be modified 
to adjust the categories to certain situations. The use of membership functions allows us to increase 
computation accuracy and customize the tool to diverse applications. Following alteration 
of the catchment in the SWMM GUI allows for accurate portrayal of the real condition of the catchment; 
no issues were encountered in altering the *inp file.

## Requirements
* Python 3

## Usage
Create a virtual environment:
```
python3 -m venv venv
```
Download and install the required dependencies: 

```
python3 pip install -r requirements
``` 
To run the script, use the following command:
```
python3 rcg.runner file path
``` 
where `file path` is the path to the SWMM model file.

Enter data into the terminal according to the instructions it displays.
The file is automatically saved in the same directory.  

## About
For the construction of the catchment generator, the type of land use was divided according to Table 1, 
the land cover according to Table 2. 
The categories were determined on the basis of the data presented by (Dołęga, Rogala, 1973), given below in Table 3.
