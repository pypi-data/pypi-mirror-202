# dmenuplaylist
dmenuplaylist is a simple playlist manager for use with mpv.  You can add files,
urls, images, whatever mpv will play to your playlist and open that playlist in
mpv. Checkout the repo for a lua script to automatically remove any item in your
playlist once you've finished watching it. 

You can set the `remove` value in `dmenuplaylist.conf` to a comma separated list
of any of the values returned by
[end-file](https://mpv.io/manual/master/#command-interface-end-file). The
default value of `remove` is `eof` but you can use something like this if you like:

```conf
remove=eof,quit,file_error
```

The `stop` reason seems to come up a lot with torrents or
youtube/stream links so it is advised to avoid using that
setting.
