# eAwaiter
eAwaiter is a Python package that can change your eAsistent meals automatically.

## Description
eAwaiter is supposed to help with changing meals in eAsistent. Meals are "changable" only 7 days in advance. Therefore, waiter's service looks for any disliked foods and favourite foods and changes meals few weeks in future. I can also help manually changing meals and more.

eAwaiter's service (and more) is used in [eAmenu](https://github.com/5KRC1/eAmenu) android app.

## Install & Run
If you are changing the code or using it locally, you can easily install and run it with the following commands:
- Clone the project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/5KRC1/eAwaiter && cd eAmenu
```
- Setup Python venv
```bash
python -m venv env && source env/bin/activate
```
- Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Run the example provided under "Usage"
```bash
python examples/example.py
```

## Usage

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/5KRC1/eAwaiter.git
```

waiter = Waiter(

action = "prijava"
meal_id = "__meal_id__"
date = datetime(2023, 3, 29)  # (year, month, day)
