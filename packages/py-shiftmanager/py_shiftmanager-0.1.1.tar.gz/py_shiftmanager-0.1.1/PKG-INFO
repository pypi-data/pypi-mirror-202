# Py-ShiftManager
#### v0.1.1

Py-ShiftManager is a Python module that provides a managed queue environment for handling IO and computational tasks, allowing you to easily manage concurrency and multiprocessing without worrying about the details.

## Installation
You can install Py-ShiftManager using pip:
`pip install py-shiftmanager`

## What's new in v0.1.1
This small update is dedicaded to my friend Ram :).
* Introducing new timeout wrapper: *timeout_timer* - import it, decorate your functions, set amount of seconds, get a result for a task that has timed out without blocking your flow. 
* Better thread locking system to ensure even smaller chances of getting in a deadlock situation.  
* *ShiftManager_Compute* now initializes the number of workers with the number of CPU's available in the system, by default.  
* *ShiftManager_IO* now initializes the number of workers to 2, instead of 1, by default.  

## Usage
Here's an example of how to use Py-ShiftManager to handle IO tasks:  
`from py-shiftmanager import ShiftManager_IO`.  
Now, lets also import *timeout_timer* wrapper:  
`from py-shiftmanager.timeout import timeout_timer`

# Create a new ShiftManager instance with 4 workers
`manager = ShiftManager_IO(num_of_workers=4)`  

**Note**: by default *ShiftManager* objects init with these values for its attributes:
* num_of_workers = `2`
* daemon = `False`
* queue size = `10`    

Also, by default the output queue is sent to 1.5 times the input queue size.
  
# Add some tasks to the input queue
Assume we have created a function and applied the *timeout_timer* decorator, incase a task takes longer than 3 seconds to complete, like so:  
`import requests`  
`@timeout_timer(seconds=3)`  
`def get_status(url):`  
`   return requests.get(url).status_code`  
We can assign single tasks to the queue:  
`manager.new_task(get_status, "http://www.google.com")`  
`manager.new_task(get_status, "http://www.facebook.com")`  
`manager.new_task(get_status, "http://www.twitter.com")`   
Or we can submit a batch by passing a list of tuples:  
`tasks = [(get_status, "http://www.google.com"),(get_status, "http://www.facebook.com")]`  
`manager.new_batch(tasks)`

# Handle the tasks
`manager.handle_work()`  
*ShiftManager* spins up the workers and starts consuming tasks from the input queue.  
Since we applied the *timeout_timer* decorator, if a task takes longer than 3 seconds - it will be terminated, but you'll still recieve a result with the task details, and that it has ran out of time.  

# Wait for the tasks to complete
`manager.end_shift()`  
This method sends a shut-down signal to all workers and waits for them to shut-down gracefully.

**Note**: this does not interfere with retrieving results from the output queue at any time.


And here's an example of how to use Py-ShiftManager to handle computational tasks:

`from py-shiftmanager import ShiftManager_Compute`  

# Create a new ShiftManager instance with 4 workers
`manager = ShiftManager_Compute(num_of_workers=4)`  
But this time we'll increase the number to 5 using simple addition:  
`manager + 1` - now *manager* is set to run 5 workers.

**Note**: by default *ShiftManager_Compute* init with these default values for its attributes:  
* num_of_workers = *number of CPU's in the system.*
* daemon = `False`
* queue size = `10`

# Add some tasks to the input queue
We can assign single tasks, like so:  
`manager.new_task(lambda x: x**2, 3)`  
`manager.new_task(lambda x: x**3, 4)`  
`manager.new_task(lambda x, y: x**4 + y, 5, 9)`  
or submit a batch by passing a list of tuples:  
`tasks = [(lambda x: x**2, 3),(lambda x: x**3, 4)]`
`manager.new_batch(tasks)`

**Note**: Accepting *lambda* functions and normal functions.

# Handle the tasks
`manager.handle_work()`  
*ShiftManager* will start the workers and begin performing the calculations.

# Get the results
`results = manager.get_results()`  
`print(results)` # Output: [9, 634, 9, 64, 64]

**Note**: you can retrieve results whenever you want, at any point, since results are stored in a separate queue, and all workers are running concurrently.

# Wait for the tasks to complete
`manager.end_shift()`  
This method sends a shut-down signal to all workers, they will stop gracefully.

## API

**ShiftManager_IO**  
`ShiftManager_IO(num_of_workers: int = 1, daemon: bool = False, queue_size: int = 10) -> None`  
Creates a new ShiftManager instance with the specified number of workers, daemon status, and queue size.

`new_task(func: Callable, task: Any) -> None`  
Adds a new task to the input queue.

`new_batch(tasks: List[tuple]) -> None`  
Adds a list of tasks to the input queue.

`queue_in_size() -> int`  
Returns the current size of the input queue, if implemented, else, exists gracefully.

`queue_out_size() -> int`  
Returns the current size of the output queue, if implemented, else, exists gracefully.

`handle_work() -> None`  
Handles the tasks in the input queue.

`get_results() -> List`  
Returns the results of the completed tasks from the output queue.

`end_shift() -> None`  
Ends the shift and waits for all tasks to complete.

**ShiftManager_Compute**  
`ShiftManager_Compute(num_of_workers: int = 1, daemon: bool = False, queue_size: int = 10) -> None`  
Creates a new ShiftManager instance with the specified number of workers, daemon status, and queue size.

`new_task(func: Callable, task: Any) -> None`  
Adds a new task to the input queue.

`new_batch(tasks: List[tuple]) -> None`  
Adds a list of tasks to the input queue.

`queue_in_size() -> int`  
Returns the current size of the input queue, if implemented, else, exists gracefully.

`queue_out_size() -> int`  
Returns the current size of the output queue, if implemented, else, exists gracefully.

`handle_work() -> None`  
Handles the tasks in the input queue.

`get_results() -> List`  
Returns the results of the completed tasks from the output queue.

`end_shift() -> None`  
Ends the shift and waits for all tasks to complete.  

**timeout_timer**  

`@timeout_timer(seconds: int = 5)`  
A decorator that attaches a timeout counter to your methods, use it to set a time limit to tasks in seconds; 5 seconds by default.
