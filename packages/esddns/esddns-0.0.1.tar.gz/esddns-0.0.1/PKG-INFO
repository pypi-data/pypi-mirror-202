**ESDDNS** (esddns) is an Open Source Dynamic DNS solution to automatically synchronize public 
WAN IPv4 address with a target DNS A Record when there is a configuration drift 
due to IPv4 address changes. 

Creates and manages dynamic states for WAN IPv4 and DNS Record.  
Utilizes dynamic public WAN IPv4 address discovered and retrieved from 
external IPv4 check services, automatically synchronizes it with 
managed DNS A record via REST APIs.
