    "`simtask` is a Python package within the `dlmontepython` library for automating complex tasks involving multiple simulations. Here we introduce the package and provide an example illustrating how it could be used. The example involves calculating the energy and density of the Lennard-Jones fluid using grand-canonical Monte Carlo, via the program `DL_MONTE`, for various temperatures *automatically*. The user specifies which temperatures are to be examined, links `simtask` to the relevant `DL_MONTE` executable, and then sets the `simtask` machinery in motion. The result is that plots of energy and density vs. temperature, along with associated statistical uncertainties and taking into account the equilibration time of the simulation, are generated without any input from the user."

    "We now briefly describe the key features of `simtask` with the aim of elucidating how it works. The `simtask.task` module is the heart of the package. This contains the two key Python classes, `Task` and `TaskInterface`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Task` - This is the base class corresponding to a simulation 'task', i.e. something you want to do via simulation. E.g. in the example below the 'task' is to evaluate the energy and density via grand-canonical Monte Carlo simulation. `Task` is an abstract class in the sense that it does nothing. It is subclasses of `Task` which correspond to different possible tasks, and contain code for performing these tasks. For instance the `Measurement` class is a subclass of `Task` which calculates one or more observables at a given set of thermodynamic conditions. This is used in our example below. \n",
    "\n",
    "The code for `Task` subclasses for performing simulation tasks is *general*; it is not specific to a simulation program, e.g. `DL_MONTE`. This is achieved by `Task` subclasses drawing only upon functions within the `TaskInterface` class for simulation-program-specific code. These functions constitute common things one may wish to do during a task (e.g. copy input files to a new directory, run a simulation in that directory, extract the energy from the output files of a directory), common things which can be combined into complex tasks. To enable `simtask` to be used with a given simulation program, one must write a subclass of `TaskInterface` which overloads the functions in `TaskInterface` with functions which are appropriate for that simulation code. For instance, `DLMonteInterface` is the subclass of `TaskInterface` which contains functions appropriate for the simulation program `DL_MONTE`. To perform a task in conjunction with `DL_MONTE`, the relevant `Task` subclass, e.g. `Measurement`, simply 'links' to the `DLMonteInterface`, which results in `Measurement` calling the `DL_MONTE`-specific functions for the common things during its invocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This set-up separates the code pertaining to the task one is interested in performing from the code specific to the simulation program one will use to perform that task. `Task` subclasses will in principle work for *any* simulation program which has an existing `TaskInterface`. Conversely, simulation programs which have an existing `TaskInterface` will work for any future `Task` subclasses.\n"

    "`simtask` is housed within the `dlmontepython` library (and depends on packages within that library), which can be found at the `dlmontepython` page on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/dlmontepython/) or [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/dl_monte/dlmontepython). Hence `dlmontepython` should is a prerequisiste for the examples below. Information on how to install `dlmontepython` can be found at the [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/dl_monte/dlmontepython) page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once `dlmontepython` has been installed, and the Python environment configured so that it is 'visible', `simtask` can then be used. The following command imports `simtask`. If `dlmontepython` has been installed and your environment has been configured correctly, this command should run without issue."

However we first consider the problem of evaluating these physical quantities at a *single* temperature; in Example 2 later we consider multiple temperatures. \n",

    "More specifically, we will use `simtask.measurement` to perform back-to-back grand-canonical Monte Carlo simulations with `DL_MONTE` until one of two criteria are met: 1) the energy and density (in fact, the mean number of particles in the system) are evaluated to a specified *precision*; 2) a threshold number of back-to-back simulations have been performed. Note that by 'back-to-back' we mean that the next simulation begins in the configuration where the previous simulation ended.\n",

The relevant files can be found in the directory housing this notebook. A fuller account of the significance of the contents of the input files can be found elsewhere, e.g. the `DL_MONTE` user manual (see the [DL_MONTE wiki](https://gitlab.com/dl_monte/user-hub) for links). We discuss the contents of these files only briefly here. Moreover we do not provide here an account of grand-canonical Monte Carlo or Monte Carlo simulation methodology, further details of which can be found elsewhere.

    "The input files CONTROL, CONFIG and FIELD correspond to a grand-canonical Monte Carlo simulation of the Lennard-Jones fluid as follows. The reduced temperature is $T^*=1.55112$ and the thermodynamic activity is $z=0.04$, where $T^*\\equiv k_BT/\\epsilon$, $z\\equiv\\exp(\\mu/(k_BT))$, and $\\epsilon$ denotes the well depth of the Lennard-Jones potential. Note that the $T^*$ considered is above the critical temeprature (which is $T_c^*=1.326$). The system is a cube with sides of length $10\\sigma$, where $\\sigma$ is the interparticle separation at which the Lennard-Jones is zero. The potential is truncated at a distance of $2.5\\sigma$, and no tail corrections are applied. The Monte Carlo move-set is comprised only of insertion and deletion moves; no translation moves were applied. Finally, the length of the simulation is 120,000 moves. (Note however that back-to-back simulations will be performed; hence considerably more moves than 120,000 will be used in total)."

    "During the task the simulations are performed in subdirectories of the directory `fixedprecision` earmarked as the workspace for the task. The first simulation is performed in subdirectory `sim_1`, the second in `sim_2`, etc. The task involved 6 simulations before the task was terminated on account of the threshold energy being reached. Thus within `fixedprecision` there are thus 6 subdirectories, one corresponding to each simulation. Moreover there are two files, `energy_converge.dat` and `nmol_0_converge.dat`. These contain plots of the observables and their uncertainties obtained after each simulation: the first column in each file corresponds to the simulation number, the second to the mean value of the observable, and the third to the uncertainty. Note that data is pooled from all simulations up to that point in order to come up with the mean and uncertainty. Furthermore the mean and uncertainty are calculated only using post-equilibration data: an algorithm is used to detect when the system has equilibrated, and data obtained before that is ignored in calculating the mean and uncertainty. Details of how the mean and uncertainty are calculated, and how equilibration is detected, is beyond the scope of this document; see the source code for details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we plot the data in the `energy_converge.dat` and `nmol_0_converge.dat` files. Note that the uncertainty in the energy and number of molecules decreases with each subsequent simulation. This reflects the fact that each subsequent simulation brings more data, enabling the energy and number of molecules to be determined to a higher precision."

We make a template with the same observables and `TaskInterface` object (pertaining to `DL_MONTE`) as before. However this time we will use slightly different termination criteria. Instead of using the precision of the energy as a termination criterion, we will impose a maximum time of 30s to the task (i.e. if 30s has elapsed, then no further simulations will be performed beyond the current one).

    "Finally we create the `MeasurementSweep` object `sweep` which will actually perform all the simulations and data analysis. The following command achieves this. Note that the list of control parameters is passed to the argument `paramvalues`. Note also that a string `\"temperature\"` has been passed to the argument `param`, which is the name of the control parameter. The result is that the `DLMonteInterface` object `interface`, which will create and modify `DL_MONTE` input files during the task, 'knows' to treat the temperature as a control parameter during the task. More specifically, in order to modify the input files appropriately for the next control parameter to be considered, it will search for the keyword `\"temperature\"` in the `DL_MONTE` input file `CONTROL`, and then modify the value of the temperature next to that keyword. Finally, we should mention that the name of the directory in which all simulations are to be performed is set to `fixedtimesweep`."

    "During the task the simulations are performed in subdirectories of the directory `fixedtimesweep` earmarked as the workspace for the task. The simulations corresponding to control parameter (i.e. temperature) 8000 were performed in the subdirectory `param_8000`, the simulations corresponding to control parameter 9000 were performed in subdirectory `param_9000`, etc. There were 10 control parameters considered, and hence there are 10 such `param_` subdirectories. Moreover there are two files, `energy_sweep.dat` and `nmol_0_sweep.dat`. These contain plots of the observables and their uncertainties obtained at each control parameter vs. control parameter: the first column in each file corresponds to the control parameter, the second to the mean value of the observable, and the third to the uncertainty. As with Example 1, the post-equilibration data from the multiple simulations performed at each control parameter are pooled in order to come up with the final mean and uncertainty. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that some of the uncertainties have value `nan`. This signifies that not enough post-equilibration data was gathered given the constraints (i.e. the finite time limit of 30s we imposed to examine each temperature) for an uncertainty to be calculated. Similar would apply to mean values if that were the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we plot the data in the `energy_sweep.dat` and `nmol_0_sweep.dat` files. Note that, as expected, the energy of the system increases, and the number of molecules in the system decreases, with increasing temperature."
