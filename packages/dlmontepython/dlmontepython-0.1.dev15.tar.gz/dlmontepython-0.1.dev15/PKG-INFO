Description: Python tools associated with the Monte Carlo simulation program DL_MONTE
        (project homepage: https://gitlab.com/dl_monte).
        
        Key functionality includes:
        - Functions for applying various analysis methods to data obtained from
          molecular simulation, including histogram reweighting and block averaging
        - A Python interface to DL_MONTE
        - A framework for automating calculations of, e.g. isotherms, using DL_MONTE 
        
        See the 'README.md' file for more detailed information about this library.
