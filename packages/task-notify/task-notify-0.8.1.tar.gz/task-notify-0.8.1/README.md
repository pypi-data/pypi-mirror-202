# Task-notify

Simple solution to run scripts/commands and send notifications via email or webhook (e.g. MS Teams) if it fails. Works great with cron to automate tasks.


Example:
```
$ tasknotify -c ./config.json --only_tasks "Free disk space" "System uptime"
29.01.2023 21:22:41 - INFO: tasknotify 0.8.0
29.01.2023 21:22:41 - INFO: Queueing worker thread for command: Free disk space
29.01.2023 21:22:41 - INFO: Queueing worker thread for command: System uptime
29.01.2023 21:22:41 - WARNING: The command Free disk space failed
29.01.2023 21:22:41 - INFO: Sending email for task: Free disk space
29.01.2023 21:22:41 - INFO: 1 command(s) failed
```

# Configuration file

tasknotify uses one configuration file to keep all needed information. Optionally, task definitions can also be split into several files and included. Running task-notify with the ```-f``` command line switch places a default ```config.json``` into your current working directory to serve as a starting point.

## hostname

String describing the host where tasknotify runs. This gets included into notification messages to distinguish the messages origin if you run the script on more than one host.

## notify_methods

The methods of notification can be configured and activated here.

### http_post

HTTP POST message.

  * active: Use this notification method
  * webhook_url: URL to HTTP Post the message to. E.g. the MS Teams webhook url.

### mail

  * active: Use this notification method
  * host:     Mail server
  * port:     Port to use
  * starttls: Use StartTTLS
  * user:     Username
  * password: Password
  * mail_from: Sender Email address
  * mail_to:   Receiver EMail address


## tasks_include_dirs

Optional list of directories, which will be included. All files in these directories need to be json-files with task definitions, e.g.

```
{
    "tasks":
    [
        {
            "name:"                 "Get free disk space",
            "cmd":                  "df",
            "timeout_s:             10,
            "args":                 ["-h", "--exclude", "tmpfs"],
            "cwd":                  ".",
            "expected_return_val:   0,
            "force_notify":         False,
            "tags":                 []
        },
        {

            "cmd":   "uname",
            "args":  ["-a"]
        }
    ]

```
Note: Only "name" and "cmd" are mandatory, all other task attributes will be filled with default values if not supplied.


See also the following ```tasks``` section.

## tasks

Task definitions. Essentially, a task is a command with optional arguments which are run like on a local shell.

Every task can have the following properties:

### name:

*mandatory*

Name of the task. Used in notifications to identify the task, must be unique across all task definitions.
### cmd:

*mandatory*

Actual command to run.
### timeout_s:

*default*: None

Timeout in seconds. If the command does not finish/return within this time, the process will be killed and the task will be considered to have failed.
### args:

*default*: []

List of command line arguments.
### cwd:

*default*: "."

Working directory.
### expected_return_val:

*default*: 0

Expected return value. If the actual return value of the command does not match this, then a notification will be send.
### force_notify:

*default*: False

ALWAYS send a notification about this task, regardless of the return value.
### tags:

*default*: []

List of tags for this task.
