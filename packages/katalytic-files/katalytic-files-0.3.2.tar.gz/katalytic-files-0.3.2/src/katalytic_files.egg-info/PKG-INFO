## Description
TODO: Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

## Installation
By itself
```bash
pip install katalytic-files
```

As part of the [katalytic](https://gitlab.com/katalytic/katalytic) collection
```bash
pip install katalytic
```

## Usage
TODO: Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Roadmap
- atomicity
- loading and saving data in different formats

## Contributing
Contributions can be made in a number of ways:
- Propose architectural or API improvements
- Propose new features
- Propose packaging, building, or deployment improvements
